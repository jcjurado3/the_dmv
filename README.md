# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

## Reflections: 
1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
- I took a look at the spec files first and checked what data was being instantiated and from there went through the lib files. I noticed what assertions were made and what classes were instantiated and methods available. This gave me somewhat more context about what was going on and what might be missing.

2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?
- Knowing what data was available and how the code was set up. 

3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
